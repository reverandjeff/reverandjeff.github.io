# I don't have **_ANY_** idea what i'm doing....SERIOUSLY

## Why?
I'm completely lost and have avoided learning languages since HTML came out and yes even avoided scripting (although i was pretty good a stitching other peoples scripts together to get by) becuase despite having a decent troublshooting gift, i just don't **THINK** like a Developer.. **YES** i've tried a couple of times, but here's what happens: 

- I have an anxiety attack and feel lightheaded and overwhelmed
- I get _lost_ and go into GodKnowsWhere land staring into space until i snap out of it
- I lose patience and get **extremely** frustrated that i can't do the advanced stuff
- I simply tell myself, **I CANNOT**
